            <h4>CMS</h4>
            <p>Content Management Systems. i was introduced to these 7 months back, i have been practicing since. My main CMS would be Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal. I have knowledge that is required to make an aesthetic website, such as: setting up a server, installing different types of CMSs, using code to style my website and creating a structure that works well with modern trends.</p>

            <h4>Photography</h4>
            <p>Capturing a moment in time and telling a story from it has to be my favorite thing to do. Ive learned how to manipulate and use light to my advantage; telling a completely different story with each picture. Investing into equipment, mainly lenses. I currently own two lenses, a 50mm prime and a 18-55mm kit lens, i use each lens at their best. Currently having a blast doing portraits with my 50mm.</p>

            <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
            <p>This is the most raw form of art there ever could be. I’ve been practicing graphic design for 4 years now, fell in love with it when i created my first movie poster. I have a great passion for creating graphics and photo manipulation. I have an advanced level of experience with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe AfterEffects and Cinema 4D. </p>
